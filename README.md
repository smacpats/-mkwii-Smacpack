# [Mkwii] Smacpack

This pack includes 95 BRSTM music files and 34 SZS track files. That = 32 tracks worth of music and 32 textured tracks. If you are the type of person who doesn't read these things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, here is the link I guess- http://bit.ly/2M0IPdO

## For CTGP Revolution 1.0.3 on a real wii

copy all of the individual BRSTM and SZS files into the folder named “My Stuff” inside your CTGPR folder on your SD card. If the folder does not exist,
create it. Make sure that “My stuff” is enabled in the CTGP options menu before starting your game.

If you wish to just use the music or the textures, only copy either the brstm (the music files) or the szs files (the textures).


## For the track textures on dolphin or an ISO image

copy all of the individual the SZS files (everything inside of the “SZS files” folder, into /files/Race/Course.

For the music, copy all of the brstm files (everything inside of the “BRSTM files” folder) into files/sound/strm/.

...and recompile your ISO.

Stuff may be broken. This is still a fairly early version.
